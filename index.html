          I’m a first year student at ESSEC BBA French Track in Cergy, France 👨‍🎓. I’m 17 years old. I could tell you a lot about me, but I'll be brief 😉. If I can reflect an image of a rather carefree surfer 🏄, I am actually a very serious person. I work hard and put a lot of effort into a lot of things that are important to me 📚. Finally, I'm a very social person, who loves to meet new people and discover their stories. Each person is a treasure of discovery in my eyes.
          Below is a link to the site of the largest Android community in the world. It's a community I follow a lot.

        <h2>Japan 🇯🇵</h2>
        <p>
          I am passionate about Japanese culture, and in all the fields it encompasses. I love anime, Japanese art as well as traditional food and the history of the country. I have never had the chance to visit the country, but I plan to do some of my studies there 😎.
          My dream would be to visit Osaka during the "Hanami" period, the blooming of the sakura cherry trees, in April 🌸.

        <h2>Literature 📖</h2>
        <p>
          My mother being a librarian, I have been immersed in the world of books and literature since my childhood. I am therefore a great reader, especially during my vacations.
          My favorite book is "Horla", written by the French author Guy de Maupassant. I love fantasy short stories, and this book is for me the most accomplished of all those I have read.

        <h2>Cooking 👨‍🍳</h2>
        <p>
          I am also very passionate about cooking. I started to take a serious interest in complex recipes during the lockdown (since we had to keep busy...). So I'm very good at Asian cooking (especially Japanese as you can imagine), and also at making desserts. I'm sure you've never eaten such a good Millefeuille 🍰 as mine!
